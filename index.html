				<img src="image/car.webp" width="460px" height="300px" alt=""/>
				<p>
				Audi’s family of electric vehicles was expanded with the addition of the Q4 E-Tron in April this year, when both the regular and Sportback models were unveiled. Now ready to be configured online at the brand’s official site, the electric crossover duo has been priced, and it’s fair to say it’s very competitively positioned.The cheapest 2022 Q4 E-Tron money can buy costs $43,900 for the Q4 40 E-Tron, which has one electric motor and an 82-kWh battery pack. If you go for the more powerful twin-motor Q4 50 E-Tron, it will set you back at least $49,900 with the same battery. The most expensive model is the Q4 Sportback 50 E-Tron, which has an MSRP of $52,700. All prices are Manufacturer’s Suggested Retail Price and exclude the $1,095 handling and destination fees.<span style="color:green">(12hours age)</span></p>

			<p><b>What is Commercial Paper?</b><br/>Commercial paper, also called CP, is a short-term debt instrument issued by companies to raise funds generally for a time period up to one year. It is an unsecured money market instrument issued in the form of a promissory note and was introduced in India for the first time in 1990.
			Companies that enjoy high ratings from rating agencies often use CPs to diversify their sources of short-term borrowings. This gives investors an additional instrument. They are typically issued by large banks or corporations to cover short-term receivables and meet short-term financial obligations, such as funding for a new projectCPs have a minimum maturity of seven days and a maximum of up to one year from the date of issue. However, the maturity date of the instrument should typically not go beyond the date up to which the credit rating of the issuer is valid. They can be issued in denominations of Rs 5 lakh or multiples thereof.Since such instruments are not backed by collateral, only firms with high ratings from a recognised credit rating agency can sell such commercial papers at a reasonable price. CPs are usually sold at a discount to their face value, and carry higher interest rates than bonds ....&nbsp;<a href="">Read More >></a></p>

			Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it has invested more than $13 billion in safety and security measures since 2016, days after a newspaper reported the company had failed to fix "the platform's ill effects" researchers had identified.The social media giant said it now has 40,000 people working on safety and security, compared with 10,000 five years ago.Facebook played down the negative effects on young users of its Instagram app and had a weak response to alarms raised by employees over how the platform is used in developing countries by human traffickers, the Wall Street Journal reported last week, citing a review of internal company documents."In the past, we didn't address safety and security challenges early enough in the product development process," the company said in a blog post. "But we have fundamentally changed that approach."Facebook said its artificial intelligence technology has helped it block 3 billion fake accounts in the first half of this year. The company also removed more than 20 million pieces of false COVID-19 and vaccine content.The company said it now removes 15 times more content that violates its standards on hate speech across Facebook and its image-sharing platform Instagram than when it first began reporting it in 2017.... &nbsp;<a href="">Read More >></a>

			<p><b>Fondue in Switzerland or Dubai's shawarma: Top 5 must-have local dishes</b><br/>
				If you are looking for something that would give you cuisine memories of a country you are in, the best way is to try the most-popular dish that the locals enjoy. Here’s a list of 5 such!<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>SHAWARMA IN DUBAI</b><br/>
				Most places in Dubai would have shawarma encompassing tomatoes, onions dotted with sumac, tahini, parsley and most certainly garlic aioli and pickles. At some places the shawarma is also stuffed with French fries. The best Shawarma undoubtedly is at The Address Fountain View and Em Sherif overlooking the majestic Burj Khalifa.
				<br/>
				<br/><b>FONDUE IN SWITZERLAND</b><br/>
				The Swiss cheese fondue is a local favourite, more so during the winters, but I would endorse trying it any time you travel. Melted cheese may sound strange to you as a first timer but this is something you should absolutely try. Fondue is essentially a blend of melted cheese (usually a blend of gruyere and vacherin fribourgeois) and white wine foaming over a tiny burner in which you dip bread and say cheese as you bite into the deliciousness. Enjoy a glass of white wine with your meal - the locals dash it with a flute of kirsch at the conclusion to relieve digestion.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>PAD THAI IN THAILAND</b><br/>
				These soaked dried rice noodles, are sauteed with eggs, sliced firm tofu and dried shrimp; seasoned with tamarind pulp, fish sauce, shallots, garlic, palm sugar and red chili pepper and served with lime wedges and chopped roasted peanuts. You will this staple nearly everywhere and can ask to add or delete ingredients as per your preference. Thip Samai restaurant in old Bangkok makes a mean one.
				<br/><br>
				<b>SAUSAGES IN GERMANY</b><br/>
				One can't not think of Germany when speaking of sausages, being the mecca destination of faithful meat lovers. Germany has a prodigious opulence in terms of gastronomic creations, the sausage to be precise is top of the list. There are over fifteen hundred arrays of sausages in the country and make for the most popular street food; most popular being the Bratwurst and currywurst. Interestingly, a common ancient saying in Bavari a goes 'The weiwurste should not hear the noon bell ringing' owing to the lack of additives to preserve. Most restaurants do not sell this sausage post midday.
				<br/><br/>
				<b>BREAKFAST IN MALDIVES</b><br/>
				This vigorous blend of tuna, chilli, grated coconut and onion usually eaten cold with tea and roshi which is quite like our Indian Chapatti is a preferred Maldivian breakfast. A resort breakfast will however comprise of a lot of tropical fruits, fresh juices, eggs and toast along with this staple.
